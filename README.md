This project checks password strength using Python.
It evaluates length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers,
and special characters to improve security awareness.

📌 Project Description
The Password Strength Checker is a Python-based cyber security project that evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords. It analyzes passwords based on length, character variety, and complexity to help users create strong and secure passwords. Weak passwords are one of the main reasons for security breaches, and this project aims to reduce that risk.

🎯 Objectives
To identify weak passwords.
To improve password security awareness.
To prevent brute-force and guessing attacks.
To guide users in creating strong passwords.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used.
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: re (Regular Expressions)
Interface: Command Line Interface (CLI)
IDE: VS Code 
Operating System: Windows 

🔍 Features
Checks minimum password length.
Detects uppercase and lowercase letters.
Detects numbers and special characters.

Classifies password strength as:
Weak ❌
Medium ⚠️
Strong ✅
Provides suggestions to improve weak passwords

⚙️ How It Works
The user enters a password.
The system checks the password against predefined security rules.
A score is calculated based on satisfied conditions.
Password strength is displayed.
Suggestions are shown if the password is weak or medium.
